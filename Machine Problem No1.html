        <p style="text-align:center"><p style="font-family:Calibri ; font-size: 25px;">I'm Jowel Caballero my course is Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering. While entering into the college in University of the East Manila, I am full with thoughts, energy and good faith inside myself. I love myself and the entire that encompasses me. I always loved to interact with people. I like to know people and make friends. 
        I am a social person and go out with my friends and family. Also, I like to visit new places. While growing up I have realized that I am an individual but I play several roles throughout the day. As per these roles, my behavior and attitude keep altering. This variation adds various shades in my personality. I am a youngest child. I try to listen and follow what my parents teach me. When I do well in studies, they become proud. I get lots of love, care and attention from my parents.  I also care, love, and respect them. My parents are my first identity in this world.</p>
