                  <h2>JOWEL CABALLERO</h2>
                  <p>I am full with thoughts, energy and good faith inside myself. I love myself and the entire that encompasses me. 
                    I always loved to interact with people. I like to know people and make friends.
                    I am a social person and go out with my friends and family. Also, I like to visit new places. 
                    While growing up I have realized that I am an individual but I play several roles throughout the day. 
                    As per these roles, my behavior and attitude keep altering. This variation adds various shades in my personality.
                    I am a youngest child. I try to listen and follow what my parents teach me. When I do well in studies, 
                    hey become proud. I get lots of love, care and attention from my parents.  I also care, love, and respect them. 
                    My parents are my first identity in this world. </p>
